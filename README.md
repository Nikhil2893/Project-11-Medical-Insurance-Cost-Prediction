Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

About Dataset
Context
Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.

Content
Columns

age: age of primary beneficiary

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

smoker: Smoking

region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Installation

[No Installation is required to run the code as No UI app is created in this one. The predictive system can run on Google Colaboratory.
Please open the **"Project-11-Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction.ipynb"** file with the help of Google Colaboratory]
